### Research Interests
1. Visual Science in general, both artificial and biological.
2. Cortical surface hyperalignment and its application;
3. developing deep models revealing the role of visual experience on the functional structure of vision system. 
4. The effect of how electrical stimulation on the IT cortex impact object recognition function.

### Research Experience & Project Outcome

I possess a diverse set of skills that allow me to investigate problems in the field of systems neuroscience. Specifically, I am able to conduct a variety of experiments, including fMRI, electrophysiology, and psychophysics experiments, in order to gather data and information about the brain. Additionally, I am proficient in utilizing artificial neural networks to analyze this data and uncover the rules and principles that govern cognitive function. Through this combination of experimental techniques and computational analysis, I attempt to understand the computational mechanisms of cognitive functions in the brain.

1. Under the supervision of professor Pinglei Bao, I completed my undergraduate thesis titled "Cortical hyperalignment with static images: validity and mechanism." I used the response of the visual cortex to static images to effectively align the brains of 5 subjects. The results showed that the method can be used to predict individual subject data, such as categorical selectivity, retinotopic mapping, image-by-image response etc. Furthermore, I explained the neural mechanism of using static images for cortical hyperalignment based on object space and representational similarity analysis.
2. During my rotation with professor Shiming Tang, I conducted single photon calcium imaging experiments on awake macaques to examine the response of the inferior temporal cortex to natural images. I combined the single photon data with fMRI data from humans viewing the same images, and used pixel-vertex mapping and clustering methods to cluster the cortical response patterns. Additionally, I compared the results obtained from various methods such as categorical selectivity, object space tuning, and deep neural network modeling, to verify and expand previous research on the tuning patterns of the inferior temporal cortex.
3. Under the supervision of professor Pinglei Bao and Jia Yang, I trained various convolutional deep neural networks to examine the impact of visual experience on the representation space of the visual system. The paper is currently in the process of being written.
4. Currently, I am rotating in professor Yang Zhou's laboratory, I am using fMRI to investigate brain regions that represent general categories in the human brain, regardless of perceptual modality. This study mainly uses the searchlight method to examine the performance of decoders in cross-modal decoding.

### Psychtoolbox Tutorial

As a TA for the course "Research Methods in Psychology: Matlab and Psychtoolbox," I independently created a free and open-source Chinese tutorial for Psychtoolbox, covering basic usage of Matlab, image processing, stimulus presentation, response collection, and creation of statistical graphs. The tutorial videos can be found at the following link.

## Research Interests
0. Visual Science in general, both artificial and biological.
1. The role of visual experience on the functional structure of vision system. 
2. The encoding of categorical-selective neuron to non-prefered images.
3. The calsual role of IT cortex on object recognition function.
4. Cortical surface hyperalignment and its application.

## Research Experience
Combining of experimental methods such as fMRI, electrophysiology and calcium imaging and computational techniques, I attempt to understand the computational mechanisms of high-level visual functions in the primate brain.

1. Under the supervision of Dr. Pinglei Bao, I completed my undergraduate thesis titled "Cortical hyperalignment with static images: validity and mechanism." I used the visual response to static images to align the brain surface from different subjects. This method can be used to predict subject-specific topographic feature, such as categorical selectivity, retinotopic preference and image-by-image response.
2. During my rotation with Dr. Shiming Tang, I conducted single-photon widefield calcium imaging experiments on awake macaques to examine the response of the inferior temporal cortex to natural images. I combined the single photon data with fMRI data from humans viewing the same images, and used pixel-vertex mapping and clustering methods to cluster the cortical response patterns.
3. Under the supervision of Dr.Pinglei Bao and Dr.Jia Yang, I trained various convolutional deep neural networks to examine the impact of visual experience on the representation space of the visual system.


## Other Project
### Psychtoolbox Tutorial

As a TA for the course "Research Methods in Psychology: Matlab and Psychtoolbox," I made a free and open-source Chinese tutorial for Psychtoolbox, covering basic usage of Matlab, image processing, stimulus presentation, response collection, and statistics. The tutorial videos can be found at the following link.

### BAM Online Analysis System

Combined with MonkeyLogic and AlphaOmega, this software can read electrophysiological data, experimental-related data and other necessary data in real time and perform user-specified analysis, such as categorical PSTH or closed-loop image generation.
